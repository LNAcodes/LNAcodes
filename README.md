# 👁️ Elena Iris Rosenau

I'm a former teacher transitioning into full-stack web development. I’m using my background in education to build accessible, thoughtful, and user-centered web experiences.  

Currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind. Exploring Git & GitHub, building small responsive projects with Jekyll and deploying via Netlify. Also diving into UI/UX design with Figma and storytelling through code and building small projects along the way.  

## Projects I’m working on:  
- My website
- A Raspberry Pi-powered cat cam 🐱 
- An app for people with Celiac Disease 🌾 

I’m always exploring new ideas and improving my skills, driven by a passion for creating tools that make a difference. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me lost in a good book.
